				<p><span style="color:black">SubHub</span> (name subject to change) is a project that I did as part of an online course with <span style="color:black">Career Foundry</span>, but also the result of my own awareness of a growing economic trend among digital service and entertainment industries: <span style="color:black">Subscriptions</span>. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Let's start by showcasing a reality that is arguably hidden.</p>
				<br>
				<p>$15 dollars per month seems like a manageable expense, perhaps even negligible. That's the current accepted price for Netflix has been selling monthly subscriptions to users for below $10 in the past, although that is subject to change soon. Hulu sells an ad-free experience for $15, same as YouTube Red. Spotify hovers at $10, data sells for about $5 for 2TB according to Google Drive and Apple iCloud. Students often get a deal too.</p>
				<br>
				<p>	We buy a lot of things for monthly subscriptions, but what we fail to really witness is the amount that it becomes over time. World of Warcraft costs $15 dollars per month if you pay month-to month, $12 per month for monthly subscriptions. if you've had an account for 5 years, you've paid between $720 and $900 dollars.</p>
				<br>
				<p>	So... what? </p>
				<br>
				<p>	Things cost over time, that's normal. Maybe they cost a bit more than before but that's also a natural happenstance. </p>
				<br>
				<p>	The problem that subscriptions generate, and the opportunity for me to seize, is that they allow a system in which companies benefit from facilitating users forgetting to unsubscribe. For years, my dad received an email every month from a stray subscription to a game that none of his children played. Every month he would be furious for about 30 mins about a painful reminder that he still hasn't unsubscribed from this game despite asking each time whether he can, who is still playing, etc. </p>
				<br>
				<p>My dad is someone who gets things done, so the fact that this loop had remained open for so long was likely causing him a lot of unwanted stress and anger. His continued subscription was not a result of laziness; it can just be made into an obnoxiously difficult process, and he even admitted during my user research that he didn't know how. </p>
				<br>
				<p>I saw an opportunity to help users avoid getting taken advantage of. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Ok, for the sake of unbiased work, a lot of companies are very legitimate and straightforward about allowing users to quit when they need, and some employ tactics that reward loyalty rather than punish attempts to leave, but there are a lot of examples of very poorly designed, or even purposefully difficult unsubscribing processes. You can find examples on r/assholedesign. The biggest problem are the micro subscriptions that stay hidden and active for long periods of time. </p>
				<br>
				<p>My goal with this app from the beginning was to increase user awareness of the amount they were spending on monthly subscriptions to products and services, but also to allow them intuitive and reliable control over which ones are active and inactive. </p>
				<br>
				<p>As with most of my work, this project was oriented towards giving users better control over their digital presence and actions.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I called it SubHub because it sounded better than Subr and it indicated a place where subscriptions can be found, but that was copyrighted in 2017, the same year that I started working on this. I'll have to change the name if this becomes a business. </p>
				<br>
				<p><b><u>TL;DR:</b></u> This is my attempt at improving user subscription awareness and control,  because subscriptions are deceptively expensive and sometimes difficult to get rid of.</p>
