	<h4>User Experience Design</h4>

	<br>
	<p>User Experience (UX) is more than building an app or website from the ground up and pushing pixels; it is the design of an experience from top to bottom.</p> 
	<br>
	<p><i>What does that mean?</i></p>
	<br>
	<p>it means holding your user's hand through an onboarding process that <b>feels</b> human, and giving them a good reason to come back for more. It means putting yourself in the shoes of a user and thinking about what they need, or better yet asking them them, and then building the product from end-to-end with meticulous emphasis on the details.</p>
	<br>

		<h4>So Which Experiences Do I Craft?</h4>

			<br>
			<p>I design events for gamers who want to be social and meet their fellow peers in a bar or catered environment</p>
			<br>
			<p>I design apps for mobile and desktop that help users regain control over their habits, attention, and information.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I design training plans for people who want the athletic gamer experience, which brings my knowledge of sportsmanship to the growing eSports industry.</p>
			<br>

		<h4>My Designer Ethics</h4>

			<br>
			<p>I believe that <s>users</s> people have lost a lot of control over their behavior, specifically their attention, with the rise of social media and mobile apps. As such, I think it is important for users to regain control over when their attention is disrupted by their mobile devices, and know when to disconnect for the sake of their mental health. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Further, I believe that if each user is attached to an extensive profile, stored in a variety of databases, that they should at the very least have access to their own profile, and choose what can and cannot be shared or used for advertisment purposes. We as designers should help users feel safe about the information that they give us, and be respectful by avoiding a data hoarding mentality.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I believe in human centered design that will restore humanity's rights to privacy and to control over their selves.</p>
